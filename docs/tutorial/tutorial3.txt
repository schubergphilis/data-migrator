Advanced record generation
==========================

See the :doc:`previous <tutorial2>` tutorial.

A typical case in system evolution is the growing complexity of entities into more detailed
records. For example a system that maintains grouping can be expanding in more interlinked
entities in the new system. This might generate more (linked) entities. *data-migrator* is
build for these kind of situations.

One to many records
-------------------

Linked to every model is a manager, which contains all logic to parse and emit records. By default
this is a simple manager that scans one record per row. In those cases the system has to generate
many, this is easily achieved by adding a dedicated manager:

.. code-block:: python

  from data_migrator import models

  class ResultManager(models.Manager):
    def transform(self, row, previous, model):
      defaults = {'c':'default value'}
      res = [
        model(**defaults).scan(row),
        model(**defaults).scan(row),
        model(**defaults).scan(row)
      ]
      res[1].a += 'some postfix'
      res[2].a += 'alternative postfix'
      return res

  class Result(models.Model):
    id = models.IntField(pos=0) # keep id
    a  = models.StringField(pos=1)
    b  = models.StringField(pos=2, nullable=None)
    c  = models.StringField()

    class Meta:
      manager = ResultManager

This example is not really useful, it just generates 3 records instead of one.

Multi models generation
-----------------------

The manager setup is one of the big reasons to use this package instead of
simple scripts. In our model migrations we came across, steps in which we had
to generate secondary models (for example permissions or links between models).

.. code-block:: python

  from data_migrator import models

  class PermissionManager(models.Manager):
    def transform(self, row, previous, model):
      defaults = {
        'model_id': previous[0][0].a, # due to order permission will get a result
        'user': row[0]
      }
      res = [
        model(right='read_result', **defaults),
        model(right='update_result', **defaults),
        model(right='delete_result', **defaults)
      ]
      return res

  class Permission(models.Model):
    id       = models.IntField()
    right    = models.StringField()
    model_id = models.StringField()
    user     = models.StringField()

    class Meta:
      manager = PermissionManager

  class Result(models.Model):
    id = models.IntField(pos=0) # keep id
    a  = models.StringField(pos=1)
    b  = models.StringField(pos=2, nullable=None)


  if __name__ == "__main__":
    transform.Transformer(models=[Result, Permission], emitter=MySQLEmitter).process()

The order in the transformer ``models`` list is important and determines the
order of object creation. This is an example on how one model can be used in
the generation of the second one.
