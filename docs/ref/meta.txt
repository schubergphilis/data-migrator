Meta class reference
=====================

.. currentmodule:: data-migrator.models

This document covers features of the :class:`~data-migrator.models.Meta` class. The meta class
defines model specific settings.

.. note::

    Technically, Meta is just a container and forwarded to :class:`data-migrator.models.options.Options`

Field options
=============

The following arguments are available to all field types. All are optional.

``drop_if_none``
----------------

.. attribute:: Meta.drop_if_none

Is a list of field names as defined. If set `data-migrator` will check if fields are not None
and drop if one of the columns is.

Any field listed in this attribute is checked after scanning and just before save-ing.

.. note::

    Note that only NullXXXFields actually can be ``None`` after scanning and parsing. Non
    Null fields are set to their default value.


``drop_non_unique``
-------------------

.. attribute:: Meta.drop_non_unique

If ``True``, `data-migrator` will drop values if the column uniqueness check fails
(after parsing). Default is ``False``.

Any field can be defined as a unique column. Any field set so, is checked after
scanning and just before save-ing.

``emitter``
-----------

.. attribute:: Meta.emitter

If set, `data-migrator` will use this emitter instead of the default emitter.

``fail_non_unique``
-------------------

.. attribute:: Meta.fail_non_unique

If ``True``, `data-migrator` will fail as a whole if the column uniqueness check fails
(after parsing). Default is ``False``.

Any field can be defined as a unique column. Any field set so, is checked after
scanning and just before save-ing.

``fail_non_validated``
----------------------

.. attribute:: Meta.fail_non_validated

If ``True``, `data-migrator` will fail as a whole if the column validation check fails
(after parsing). Default is ``False``.

Any field can have its own validator, this is a rough method to prevent bad data from
being transformed and loaded.

``file_name``
-------------

.. attribute:: Meta.file_name

If set, `data-migrator` will use this as file_name for the emitter instead of the default
filename based on table_name.


``table_name``
--------------

.. attribute:: Meta.table_name

If set, `data-migrator` will use this as table_name for the emitter instead of the default
tablename based on model_name.


``prefix``
----------

.. attribute:: Meta.prefix

If set, `data-migrator` will use this list of statements as a preamble in the generation of
the output statements. By default an emitter uses this to clear the old records.


``remark``
----------

.. attribute:: Meta.remark

If set, `data-migrator` will use this as the remark attribute in the Model, default='remark'.
Use this for example if you have a ``remark`` field in your model and need to free the keyword.

``manager``
-----------

.. attribute:: Meta.manager

If set, `data-migrator` will use this as the manager for this model. This is useful if
the ``transform`` method needs to be overridden.
