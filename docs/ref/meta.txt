=====================
Meta class reference
=====================

.. currentmodule:: data_migrator.models

This document covers features of the *Meta* class.
The meta class defines model specific settings and is used as an inner class
in the model:

.. code-block:: python

  from data_migrator import models

  class SampleModel(models.Model):
    a = models.IntField(pos=1)

    class Meta:
      drop_if_none = True

Every model can have its own meta class to define model specific options.

.. note::

    Technically, Meta is just a container and forwarded to :class:`~.Options`


.. autoclass::  data_migrator.models.options.Options
  :members:

.. note::

    Note that only NullXXXFields actually can be ``None`` after scanning and
    parsing. Non Null fields are set to their default value.
