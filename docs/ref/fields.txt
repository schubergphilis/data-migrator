.. module: data_migrator.models.fields
   :synopsis: Built-in field types.

.. currentmodule: data_migrator.models.fields

This document contains all API references of BaseClass :class:`~.BaseField`
including the `field options`_ and `field types`_ data_migrator offers.

.. note::

    Technically, these models are defined in :mod:`data_migrator.models.fields`
    , but for convenience they're imported into :mod:`data_migrator.models`,
    the standard convention is to use ``from data_migrator import models`` and
    refer to fields as ``models.<Foo>Field``

    violated.
