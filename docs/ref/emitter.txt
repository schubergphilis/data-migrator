=======================
Emitter class reference
=======================

.. currentmodule:: data_migrator.emitters

This document covers features of the :class:`~data_migrator.emitter.BaseEmitter` class. Currently the
system has two emitters: ``CSVEmitter`` and ``MySQLEmitter`` implemented, of which the last is the
default emitter. An emitter provides the export format for the scanned and cleaned datasets. It also
provides preambles in the output files, for example to clean the target table before loading it.

The basic structure for emitting is a combination between ``manager`` and ``emitter``:

.. code-block:: python

  e = Emitter(manager=Model.objects)
  print e.preamble(header=[..my header lines to add..])
  for l in Model.objects.all():
    print e.emit(l)  # emit is returning a list of strings!


.. note::

    At this moment *data-migrator* does not an actively take part in schema migrations of any
    sort. It is purely about cleaning and transforming data (yet!).
