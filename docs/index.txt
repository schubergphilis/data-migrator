Welcome to data-migrator!
============================================

*data-migrator* is database transformation in a pipes and filter,
declarative way, Python/Django style.

Data transformation is an important process in software development when
architectures evolve and data has to move along. This requires fast and easy
restructuring of data in a frictionless and repetitive way. Quite quickly
ad-hoc scripts or transfer data, upgrade it in sql second is not flexible
enough. For those cases *data-migrator* is an answer.

Once you 've :doc:`installed </install>` *data-migrator*, we recommend:

  * to take a look at the :doc:`Example </example>` first
  * after that continue with the :doc:`Tutorial </tutorial/tutorial0>`
  * or read the :doc:`About </about>` if you want some more background
